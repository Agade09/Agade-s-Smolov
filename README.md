# Agade's-Smolov
My adaptation of the smolov base cycle (also called "Smolov Jr").

## Differences

### Inconsistent intensity

The smolov base cycle suggests adding 10kg in week 2 and another 5kg in week 3. The problem is that this adds the same amount of weight to day 1 and day 4.
If we look at the percentages chosen for week 1 of the smolov base cycle: 70% for sets of 9, 75% for sets of 7, 80% for sets of 5, 85% for sets of 3. One can quickly see, using a RM calculator that those percentages are chosen such that intensity is constant across the week.
However, when we add a constant 10kg to both 70% and 85% in week 2, we are no longer maintaining a constant intensity across the week.
Indeed, let us imagine a smolov base cycle for a 100kg 1RM. W1D1 is 70kg, W1D4 is 85kg, W2D1 is 80kg and W2D4 is 95kg. If we use an [online RM calculator](https://exrx.net/Calculators/OneRepMax) we can see that 70kg for sets of 9 and 85kg for sets of 3 corresponds to the same intensity of 90kg. But 80kg for sets of 9 and 95kg for sets of 3 makes the sets of 9 of a harder intensity by 2kg. In week 3 the sets of 9 are of a 3kg harder intensity.
We can fix this by, for example, lifting 70/75/80/85 percent of (1RM + 12kg) instead of lifting (70/75/80/85% 1RM) +10kg.

TLDR: I believe the author of smolov intended for intensity to be constant across the week, it is slightly not. As compared to the smolov base cycle, Agade's smolov has slightly lighter days 1,2 and 3.

### Weight addition

The smolov base cycle recommends adding 19kg in week 2 and another 5kg in week 3. I believe this recommendation is made for the average male with, let's say a 150kg squat.
But does it make any sense for a, e.g. small female lifter, with a 60kg squat to add 10kg from one week to the next? That is relatively a 2.5 times bigger jump than for the 150kg squatting male.
I hypothesise that the weekly increment should be proportional to the previous week's weight. The increase percentage chosen in the spreadsheet is such that it will approximately give the 10kg and 5kg increases of the smolov base cycle in the case of a ~150kg 1RM.

## Conveniences

### Adding weeks

If your program is going very well, the spreadsheet includes buttons to add an extra week.

### Squat every day

If you are able and willing you can optionally have a 7 day version of the program which spreads out the volume across the week. This makes the volume a bit more manageable and the increased frequency may be beneficial to your progress.
